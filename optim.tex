\begin{abstract}
Projection pursuit (PP) is a dimension reduction technique that
identifies low-dimensional projections in high-dimensional data by
optimising a criteria function known as the PP index. The optimisation
in PP can be non-smooth and requires identifying optima with a small
``squint angle'', detectable only from close proximity. To address these
challenges, this study investigates the performance of a recent
swarm-based algorithm, Jellyfish Search Optimiser (JSO), for optimising
PP indexes. The performance of JSO is evaluated across various
hyper-parameter settings and compared with existing optimisers.
Additionally, this work proposes novel methods to quantify two
properties of the PP index -- smoothness and squintability -- that
capture the complexities inherent in PP optimisation problems. These two
metrics are evaluated with JSO hyper-parameters to determine their
effect on JSO success rate. The JSO algorithm has been implemented in
the \texttt{tourr} package, while calculations for smoothness and
squintability are available in the \texttt{ferrn} package.

\section{Introduction {[}Nicolas and
Jessica{]}}\label{introduction-nicolas-and-jessica}

Projection Pursuit (PP) is a high-dimensional data visualisation
approach that involves computing informative linear projections of data
by optimising a variety of objective functions, namely \emph{PP index}
(\citet{hall1989polynomial}, \citet{cook1993projection},
\citet{lee2010projection}, \citet{Loperfido2018},
\citet{Loperfido2020}). Given high-dimensional data
\(X \in \mathbf{R}^{n\times p}\) and the index function \(f(\cdot)\), PP
finds the orthonormal projection matrix
\(A \in \mathbf{R}^{p \times d}\) by solving the following optimisation
problem:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-optimization}{
\underset{A}{\max } \quad f(XA) \quad \text{subject to} \quad A'A = I
}\end{equation}

These indices \(f(\cdot)\) are characterised by the informativeness or
``interestingness'' of a projection and are often non-linear and
non-convex. As such, an effective and efficient optimisation procedure
is essential to enable sufficient exploration of the data landscape
during the visualisation process and to arrive at a global optimal
viewpoint of the data.

Significant efforts have been devoted to enhancing the functionality of
PP and facilitating a better experience in the visualisation process.
\citet{cook1995grand} introduced the PP guided tour, which enabled
interactive visualisation of the optimisation to visually explore
high-dimensional data. It is implemented in the R \citep{R} package
\texttt{tourr}\citep{tourr}. \citet{RJ-2021-105} highlighted potential
problems of the optimisation routine implemented. While improving the
quality of the optimisation solutions in the tour is essential, it is
also important to be able to watch the projected data as the
optimisation progresses. As such, it is pertinent to integrate the
guided tour with a global optimisation algorithm that is efficient in
finding the global optimal and enables viewing of the projected data
during the exploration process.

The artificial Jellyfish Search Optimiser (JSO) \citep{chou_novel_2021}
is a swarm-based metaheuristic designed to solve global optimisation
problems. Inspired by the search behaviour of jellyfish in the ocean,
JSO is one of the latest swarm intelligence algorithms
\citep{rajwar_exhaustive_2023}, which was shown to have stronger search
ability and faster convergence with fewer parameters compared to classic
optimisation methods \citep{chou_novel_2021}-\citep{chou_recent_2022}.
These practical properties makes JSO a strong candidate in integration
with the PP guided tour. As such, it is of interest to explore the
potential of JSO in enhancing the PP guided tour and examine the
characteristics and advantages of such implementation.

The primary goal of this study is to investigate the performance of JSO
in the context of the Projection pursuit. A series of simulation
experiments using well-recognised data sets and PP indexes are conducted
to yield insights regarding the behaviour of JSO under different
settings and the sensitivity of hyper-parameter in the optimisation.
Second, to observe the performance of JSO with different types of PP
indexes, a collection of metrics is introduced to capture specific
properties of the index including squintability and smoothness as
introduced in \citet{laa_using_2020}. To the best of the authors'
knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantitatively measure
squintability and smoothness in this context. Finally, the relationship
between the JSO performance, hyper-parameters tuning and various
properties of PP indexes is analysed to provide helpful guidance for
practitioners that are using the guided tour for high dimensional
visualisation.

The rest of this paper is structured as follows.
Section~\ref{sec-background} introduces the background of the PP guided
tour and reviews existing methods in the literature.
Section~\ref{sec-theory} describes the details of JSO and introduces
metrics that measure different properties of PP indexes.
Section~\ref{sec-vis} visualises the behaviour of the JSO in terms of
describes a simulation study on the performance of the JSO using
well-known data sets and index functions. Section~\ref{sec-app} displays
two sets of simulation experiments comparing the JSO with the
search-better optimiser and studies the impact of different PP index
properties on the optimisation performance. Section~\ref{sec-conclusion}
summarises the work and provides suggestions for future directions.

\section{Projection pursuit, index functions and optimisation {[}Di and
Sherry{]}}\label{sec-background}

A tour on high-dimensional data is constructed by geodesically
interpolating between pairs of planes. Any plane is described by an
orthonormal basis, \(A_t\), where \(t\) represents time in the sequence.
The term ``geodesic'' refers to maintaining the orthonormality
constraint so that each view shown is correctly a projection of the
data. The PP guided tour operates by geodesically interpolating to
target planes (projections) which have high PP index values, as provided
by the optimiser. The geodesic interpolation means that the viewer sees
a continuous sequence of projections of the data, so they can watch
patterns of interest forming as the function is optimised. There are
five optimisation methods implemented in the \texttt{tourr} package:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{search\_geodesic()}: provides a pseudo-derivative
  optimisation. It searches locally for the best direction, based on
  differencing the index values for very close projections. Then it
  follows the direction along the geodesic path between planes, stopping
  when the next index value fails to increase.
\item
  \texttt{search\_better()}: is a brute-force optimisation searching
  randomly for projections with higher index values.
\item
  \texttt{search\_better\_random()}: is essentially simulated annealing
  \citep{Bertsimas93} where the search space is reduced as the
  optimisation progresses.
\item
  \texttt{search\_posse()}: implements the algorithm described in
  \citet{posse95}.
\item
  \texttt{search\_polish()}: is a very localised search, to take tiny
  steps to get closer to the local maximum.
\end{itemize}

There are several PP index functions available: \texttt{holes()} and
\texttt{cmass()} \citep{cook1993projection}; \texttt{lda\_pp()}
\citep{lee2005projection}; \texttt{pda\_pp()} \citep{lee2010projection};
\texttt{dcor2d()} and \texttt{splines2d()} \citep{Grimm2016};
\texttt{norm\_bin()} and \texttt{norm\_kol()} \citep{huber85};
\texttt{slice\_index()} \citep{Laa:2020wkm}. Most are relatively simply
defined, for any projection dimension, and implemented because they are
relatively easy to optimise. A goal is to be able to incorporate more
complex PP indexes, for example based on scagnostics (\citet{scag},
\citet{WW08}).

An initial investigation of PP indexes, and the potential for
scagnostics is described in \citet{laa_using_2020}. To be useful here an
optimiser needs to be able to handle index functions which are possibly
not very smooth. In addition, because data structures might be
relatively fine, the optimiser needs to be able to find maxima that
occur with a small squint angle, that can only be seen from very close
by. One last aspect that is useful is for an optimiser to return local
maxima in addition to global because data can contain many different and
interesting features.

\section{The jellyfish optimiser and properties of PP indexes {[}Nicolas
and Jessica{]}}\label{sec-theory}

JSO mimics the natural movements of jellyfish, which include passive and
active motions driven by ocean currents and their swimming patterns,
respectively. In the context of optimization, these movements are
abstracted to explore the search space in a way that balances
exploration (searching new areas) and exploitation (focusing on
promising areas). The algorithm aims to find the optimal solution by
adapting the behaviour of jellyfish to navigate towards the best
solution over iterations \citep{chou_novel_2021}.

To solve the optimisation problem embedded in the PP guided tour, a
starting projection, an index function and the maximum number of
iterations are provided as input. Then, the current projection is
evaluated by the index function. The projection is then moved in a
direction determined by a random factor, influenced by how far along we
are in the optimization process. Occasionally, completely new directions
may be taken like a jellyfish might with ocean currents. A new
projection is accepted if it is an improvement compared to the current
one, rejected otherwise. This process continues and iteratively improves
the projection, until the pre-specified maximum number of trials is
reached.

The JSO implementation involves several key parameters that control its
search process in optimization problems. These parameters are designed
to guide the exploration and exploitation phases of the algorithm. While
the specific implementation details can vary depending on the version of
the algorithm or its application, we focus on two main parameters that
are most relevant to our application: the number of jellyfish and the
maximum number of trials.

\citet{laa_using_2020} has proposed five criteria for assessing
projection pursuit indexes (smoothness, squintability, flexibility,
rotation invariance, and speed). Since not all the properties affects
the execution of the optimisation, here we consider the three relevant
properties (smoothness, squintability, and speed), and propose three
metrics to evaluate these three properties.

\subsection{Smoothness}\label{sec-smoothness}

If we evaluate the index function at some random points (like the random
initialization of the jellyfish optimizer), then we can interpret these
random index values as a random field, indexed by a space parameter: the
random projection angle. This analogy suggests to use this random
training sample to fit a spatial model, a simple one being a (spatial)
Gaussian process.

How can we define a measure of smoothness from this? The distribution of
a Gaussian process is fully determined by its mean function and
covariance function. The way the covariance function is defined is where
smoothness comes into play: if an index is very smooth, then two close
projection angles should produce close index values (strong
correlation); by contrast, if an index is not smooth, then two close
projection angles might give very different index values (fast decay of
correlations with respect to distance between angles).

Popular covariance functions are parametric positive semi-definite
functions, some of which have a parameter to capture the smoothness of
the Gaussian field. In particular, consider the Matérn class of
covariance functions, defined by

\[
K(u):=\frac{(\sqrt{2\nu}u)^{\nu}}{\Gamma(\nu)2^{\nu-1}}\mathcal{K}_{\nu}(\sqrt{2\nu}u)
\]

where \(\nu>0\) is the smoothness parameter and where
\(\mathcal{K}_\nu\) is the modified Bessel function. The Matérn
covariance function can be expressed analytically when \(\nu\) is a
half-integer, the most popular values in the literature being \(1/2\),
\(3/2\) and \(5/2\) . The parameter \(\nu\), called smoothness
parameter, controls the decay of the covariance function. As such, it is
an appropriate measure of smoothness of a random field.

In our context, we suggest to use this parameter as a measure of the
smoothness of the index function by fitting a Gaussian process prior
with Matérn covariance on a dataset generated by random evaluations of
the index function, as in the initial stage of the jellyfish random
search. There exist several R packages, such as GpGp or ExaGeoStatR, to
fit the hyperparameters of a GP covariance function on data. In this
project, we make use of the GpGp package.

The fitted value \(\nu>0\) can be interpreted as follows: the higher
\(\nu\), the smoother the index function.

\subsection{Squintability}\label{sec-squintability}

From the literature, it is commonly understood that a large squint angle
implies that the objective function value is close to optimal even when
we are not very close to the perfect view to see the structure. A small
squint angle means that index function value improves substantially only
when we are very close to the perfect view. As such, low squintability
implies rapid improvement in the index value when near the perfect view.

In this subsection, a metric to capture the notion of squintability is
proposed, and two approaches to compute this metric numerically are
detailed.

\textcolor{orange}{Here we need to add a precise, mathematical
definition of the $x$ and $y$ variables ("angle distance" to optimal?
and PP index values) used in the figures of this Section.}

{[}We generate random points that is beyond 1.5 projection distance and
interpolate. Then we fit a kernel or use nonlinear least squares.{]}

Let \(f\) represent the average PP index value with respect to the
projection angle distance to optimal, over the course of the JSO. It is
expected that for a PP index with high squint angle, the optimization
(\ref{eq-optimization}) should make substantial progress early on.
Conversely, for a PP index with low squint angle, it might take a long
while for the optimization to make substantial progress, as the
candidate projections would need to be very close to the optimal one for
the structure of the index function to be visible enough to be amenable
to efficient optimization. This observation suggests that the extreme
values of \(f'\) (the ones for which \(f''=0\), assuming that \(f\) is
twice differentiable), and the angles for which these values are
attained, should play an important role in the mathematical definition
of squintability. Noticing that \(f\) is expected to be a decreasing
function, we propose the following squintability metric:

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-squintability}{
\varsigma:=-4\min_{x}f'(x)\times\underset{x}{\arg\min}f'(x)
}\end{equation}

On the one hand, \(-\min_{x}f'(x)\) represents the largest value of the
gradient of \(-f\). On the other hand, \(\underset{x}{\arg\min}f'(x)\)
represents the angle value at which this largest gradient is attained.
Based on the above discussion, it is expected that these two values
should be both high in the case of high squintability (fast increase in
\(f\) early on), and both low in the case of low squintability (any
substantial increase in \(f\) happens very late, close to the optimal
angle). This suggest that their product (\ref{eq-squintability}) should
provide a sensible measure of squintability. The multiplicative constant
\(4\), which can be deemed arbitrary, does not change the interpretation
of the squintability metric \(\varsigma\); it is here to adjust the
range of values of \(\varsigma\) and simplify the explicit formula for
\(\varsigma\) obtained later on.

To compute the squintability metric (\ref{eq-squintability}) in
practice, several approaches are possible. The first one is to propose a
parametric model for \(f\), and use it to obtain an explicit formula for
\(\varsigma\). Numerical experiments suggest a scaled sigmoid shape as
described below. Define

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-logistic}{
\ell(x):=\frac{1}{1+\exp(\theta_{3}(x-\theta_{2}))}\ ,
}\end{equation}

which is a decreasing logistic function depending on two parameters
\(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) , such that
\(\ell(\theta_{2})=\frac{1}{2}\). Then, define

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-parametric}{
f(x)=(\theta_{1}-\theta_{4})\frac{\ell(x)-\ell(x_{\max})}{\ell(0)-\ell(x_{\max})}+\theta_{4}\ ,
}\end{equation}

which depends on three additional parameters, \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\)
, and \(x_{\max}\), such that \(f(0)=\theta_1\) and
\(f(x_{\max})=\theta_4\). Under the parametric model
(\ref{eq-parametric}), the squintability metric (\ref{eq-squintability})
can be shown to be equal to

\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-squintability-parametric}{
\varsigma=\frac{(\theta_{1}-\theta_{4})\theta_{2}\theta_{3}}{\ell(0)-\ell(x_{\max})}
}\end{equation}

In practice, the parameters of this model (\ref{eq-parametric}) can be
estimated numerically, for example by non-linear least squares, and then
used to evaluate \(\varsigma\) as in equation
(\ref{eq-squintability-parametric}).

Alternatively, one can estimate (\ref{eq-squintability}) in a
nonparametric way, for example by fitting \(f\) using kernel regression,
then numerically estimate the angle at which \(-f'\) attains its highest
value.

\textcolor{orange}{See whether further details are needed for the nonparametric approach.}

TODO: add equation reference to main text line 705

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to measure the
notion of squintability.

\subsection{Speed}\label{speed}

The speed of optimizing an index function can be measured empirically by
recording the duration of the optimisation. Alternatively, one can also
gauge the speed in terms of computational complexity of evaluating the
index function (for instance, in big O notation, with respect to the
sample size) of computing the index function.

\section{Visualisation of jellyfish optimiser}\label{sec-vis}

The data structure proposed in \citet{RJ-2021-105} is implemented for JS
optimisers and additional information such as index function used, data
dimension, and jellyfish hyper-parameters can be included as additional
columns. An example data collected from finding the sine-wave structure
in 6D data (\texttt{d\ =\ 6}) using a spline index
function(\texttt{splines2d}) is printed below:

\begin{verbatim}

The jellyfish hyper-parameters used are 50 jellyfishes
(\texttt{n\_jellies}) and a maximum of 50 tries (\texttt{max\_tries}).
The full data contains 50 simulations, recorded by the variable
\texttt{sim}, with different seeds (\texttt{seed}). Recorded in columns
\texttt{basis}, \texttt{index\_val}, \texttt{tries}, \texttt{loop} and
\texttt{time}, are the sampled projection basis, calculated index value,
iteration ID, jellyfish ID, and time taken to find the optimum,
respectively. The basis column records every visited basis before
comparing with the current (last) basis. If a visited basis has a
smaller index value than the current (last) one, JSO will keep the
current basis for the next iteration in the search but still records the
visited inferior basis. This data can be used to derive numerical
summaries and plots:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Success rate}: The success rate is defined as the proportion
  of simulations that achieve a final index value within 0.05 of the
  best index value found among all 50 simulations. In the dataset above,
  the optimal index value is 0.999. Out of the 50 simulations, 44
  achieved an index value within {[}0.949, 0.999{]}, resulting in a
  success rate of 0.88. Figure~\ref{fig-projection} shows the best
  projection found in each simulation, sorted by the index value. Most
  of the projections show a clear sine-wave structure, while the last
  six show only a straight line with clusters at the end. When local
  optima exist in the projection pursuit problem, plotting the
  projections found in each simulation or by each jellyfish can help
  identify these local optima.
\item
  \textbf{Projection distance}: The projection distance between
  projection bases and the theoretical best basis (or the empirical best
  basis if the theoretical best is unknown) is calculated as the
  Frobenius norm, which measures how close a visited basis is to the
  best basis. Plotting this projection distance against the index value
  for each basis visited reveals how the index value changes as the
  basis approaches the optimal basis, helping to identify the
  squintability of the index function.
  Figure~\ref{fig-index-value-proj-dist} shows the index value against
  the projection distance for the given example and its binned version.
  As the projection distance decreases, the index value initially
  increases with an increasing slope and then levels off. The index
  value shows greater variation at medium projection distances compared
  to small and large distances.
\end{itemize}

\section{Application {[}Di and Sherry{]}}\label{sec-app}

The JSO provides a new swarm-based search strategy to optimise
projection pursuit problems. Two examples are provided in this section
to demonstrate its performance. The first example compares its
performance with the search-better optimiser and explores how it behaves
with different combinations of hyper-parameters. The second example
studies the effect of optimisation properties defined in
Section~\ref{sec-theory}, along with jellyfish hyper-parameters, on the
outcome of the optimisation.

\subsection{Performance of JSO in pipe-finding
problems}\label{sec-app-1}

The performance of JSO is investigated in two folds: 1) compare it with
a commonly used optimiser: the search-better optimiser
\citep{RJ-2021-105, laa_using_2020}, and 2) examine its success rate
under different hyper-parameters (number of jellyfishes and maximum
number of tries). The projection pursuit problem used is finding the
pipe shape using the holes index, investigated by
\citet{laa_using_2020}.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{optim_files/figure-pdf/fig-proj-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-proj}Projections found by the jellyfish and search
better optimisers at each 10th quantile across 50 simulations. The
projection pursuit problem is to find the pipe shape using the holes
index in the 6, 8, 10, and 12-dimensional spaces. The JSO uses 100
jellyfishes and a maximum number of tries of 100. The search better
optimiser uses a maximum of 1000 tries in each step of random sampling
step before the algorithm terminates. In the 6-D data space, JSO always
finds a clear pipe shape while the search better optimiser also finds
the pipe shape but with a wide rim. At higher data dimensions, JSO finds
a higher index value and a clearer pipe shape across all the quantiles
than the search better optimiser.}

\end{figure}%

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{optim_files/figure-pdf/fig-proportion-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-proportion}Proportion of simulations reaches
near-optimal index values in the pipe-finding problem using the holes
index. The proportion is calculated based on the number of simulations,
out of 50, that achieve an index value within 0.05 of the
best-performing simulation. As the dimensionality increases, the
proportion of simulations reaching the optimal index value increases.}

\end{figure}%

Fifty simulations are conducted with both JSO and the search-better , in
four dimensions (\(d = 6, 8, 10, 12\)). The JSO uses 100 jellyfishes and
100 maximum number of tries, while the search-better optimiser allows a
maximum of 1000 samples at each iteration before the algorithm
terminates. Figure~\ref{fig-proj} presents the final projections found
by the two optimisers, broken down by 10th quantile, faceted by the data
dimension. In the 6-dimensional data scenario, JSO consistently
identifies a clear pipe shape. The search-better optimiser also finds
the pipe shape but with a wide rim, suggesting a further polish search
may be required. With increasing dimensions, JSO may not always identify
the pipe shape due to random sampling, but it still presents a pipe
shape in over 50\% of cases. When compared to the search-better
optimiser, JSO reaches higher index values and clearer pipe shapes
across all quantiles.

In the second experiment, fifty simulations are conducted at each
hyper-parameter combination to analyse its effects on the success rate
of JSO . The hyper-parameters tested include: 1) 20, 50, and 100
jellyfishes, and 2) 50 and 100 maximum number of tries. In each
simulation, the success rate is calculated as defined in
Section~\ref{sec-vis}. Figure~\ref{fig-proportion} presents the
proportion of success for each hyper-parameter combinations. As the
number of jellyfishes and maximum tries increase, the success rate also
increases. For simpler problems (6 dimensions), small parameter values
(20 jellyfishes and a maximum number of tries of 50) can already result
in high success rate, while for higher-dimensional problems (8, 10, and
12 dimensions), a combination of 100 jellyfishes and 100 maximum number
of tries is necessary for at least half of the jellyfishes to find the
optimal projection.

\subsection{Factors affecting JSO success rate: optimisation properties
and jellyfish hyper-parameters}\label{sec-app-2}

The optimisation properties, including smoothness, squintability, and
speed, offer numerical metrics to characterise the complexity of a
projection pursuit optimisation problem. This example investigates how
these metrics, along with the jellyfish search hyper-parameters (the
number of jellyfishes and the maximum number of tries), affect the
success of JSO. Simulations are conducted to obtain the success rate
across various projection pursuit problems, characterised by
shape-to-find, data dimension, and index function used, as well as
different hyper-parameter combinations. Smoothness and squintability are
calculated for each projection pursuit problem as outlined in
Section~\ref{sec-theory}. A generalised linear model is used to
construct the relationship between the success rate, jellyfish
hyper-parameters and optimisation properties.

In addition to the pipe-finding problem, a new shape, sine wave, is
investigated in 6D and 8D spaces with six indices considered:
\texttt{dcor2d\_2}, \texttt{loess2d}, \texttt{MIC}, \texttt{TIC},
\texttt{spline}, and \texttt{stringy}. Combining with two jellyfish
hyper-parameters, a total of 52 cases is produced, comprising of 24
pipe-finding cases and 28 sine-wave finding cases. For each case, JSO is
run fifty times and the success rate is calculated as in
Section~\ref{sec-app-1}.

Smoothness and squintability are computed for each case, following the
procedures outlined in Section~\ref{sec-smoothness} and
Section~\ref{sec-squintability}. To calculate smoothness, three hundred
random bases are simulated. Index values and projection distance (to the
optimal basis) are calculated for each random basis before fitting them
into a Gaussian process model. For squintability, fifty random bases are
sampled and interpolated to the optimal basis with a step size of 0.005.
For these interpolated bases, index values and projection distances to
the optimal basis are calculated and averaged with a bin width of 0.005.
The squintability measure is then calculated from fitting a 4-parameter
scaled logistic function of index value against projection distance,
estimated by non-linear least squares.

Table~\ref{tbl-smoothness-squintability} presents the parameters
estimated from the Gaussian process (variance, range, smooth, and
nugget) and the scaled logistic function (\(\theta_1\) to \(\theta_4\))
for each case. The column ``smooth'' is used as the smoothness measure
and the column ``squint'' is calculated as {[}TODO: equation
reference{]} as squintability. The low squint value of MIC and TIC index
is due to its convex shape of the index value against the projection
distance, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-idx-proj-dist}. Comparing to other
concave shapes, the maximum first derivative happens at a smaller
projection distance (\(\theta_2\)), requiring the optimiser to get
closer to the optimal to see a significant change in the index value,
hence a small squintability measure.

\caption{\label{fig-idx-proj-dist}Index values versus projection
distance for the 12 pipe/sine-wave finding problem, after the binning
procedure for calculating the squintability measure. The index values,
averaged at bin width of 0.005, are scaled from 0 to 1 for comparison
(holes, TIC, and stringy). The \texttt{MIC} and \texttt{TIC} index
curves are convex while others are concave. The stringy curve shows an
instantaneous jump to the optimum when aproaching the best basis.}

Table~\ref{tbl-mod-data} combines all the variables calculated above
(the JSO success rate, JSO hyper-parameters, and optimisation
properties) into one table. Three preprocessing steps are applied to the
data: 1) scaling the JSO hyper-parameters by a factor of 10 for
interpretation, 2) creating a new binary variable \texttt{long\_time} to
indicate cases with an average run time over 30 seconds, and 3) encoding
the success rate for the stringy case as 0, because upon visual
inspection of the final projection, none of the 50 simulations
identified the sine-wave shape. A generalised linear model with a
binomial family and a logit link function is used to fit the data and
Table~\ref{tbl-mod-output} presents the model outputs. The model
suggests that the JSO success rate is positively associated with the two
JSO hyper-parameters, as well as with the optimisation properties --
smoothness and squintability. Specifically, using 10 more jellyfish and
10 more tries will increase the odd ratio of success by 24.11\% and
11.93\%, respectively. However, being flagged with long runtime and an
increase of data dimension will reduce the success rate by 41.72\% and
53.36\%, respectively. The variable \texttt{squintability} and
\texttt{dimension} are significant, suggesting their importance relative
to JSO hyper-parameters in the optimisation success. Users can increase
the number of jellyfish and the number of tries to improve the success
rate, until JSO exceeds a 30-second runtime.
