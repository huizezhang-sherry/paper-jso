\section{Introduction {[}Nicolas and
Jessica{]}}\label{introduction-nicolas-and-jessica}

The artificial jellyfish search (JS) algorithm \citep{chou_novel_2021}
is a swarm-based metaheuristic optimisation algorithm inspired by the
search behaviour of jellyfish in the ocean. It is one of the newest
swarm intelligence algorithms \citep{rajwar_exhaustive_2023}, which was
shown to have stronger search ability and faster convergence with few
algorithmic parameters compared to classic optimization methods
\citep{chou_novel_2021}-\citep{chou_recent_2022}.

Effective optimisation is an important aspect of many methods employed
for visualising high-dimensional data (\(X\)). Here we are concerned
about computing informative linear projections of high-dimensional
(\(p\)) data using projection pursuit (PP) (\citet{kr69}, \citet{FT74}).
This involves optimising a function (e.g. \citet{hall1989polynomial},
\citet{cook1993projection}, \citet{lee2010projection},
\citet{Loperfido2018}, \citet{Loperfido2020}), called the projection
pursuit index (PPI), that defines what is interesting or informative in
a projection.

These PPI are defined on projections (\(XA\)), which means that there is
a constraint that needs to be considered when optimising. A projection
of data is defined by a \(p\times d\) orthonormal matrix \(A\), and this
imposes the constraint on the elements of \(A\), that columns need have
norm equal to 1 and the product of columns need to sum to zero.

\citet{cook1995grand} introduced the PP guided tour, which enabled
interactive visualisation of the optimisation in order to visually
explore high-dimensional data. It is implemented in the R \citep{R}
package \texttt{tourr} \citep{tourr}. The optimisation that is
implemented is fairly basic, and potential problems were highlighted by
\citet{RJ-2021-105}. Implementing better optimisation functionality is a
goal, but it needs to be kept in mind that the guided tour also has
places importance on watching the projected data as the optimisation
progresses.

Here we explore the potential for a jellyfish optimisation to be
integrated with the guided tour. Section~\ref{sec-background} explains
the optimisation that is used in the current the projection pursuit
guided tour. Section~\ref{sec-theory} provides more details on the
jellyfish optimiser and formalises several characteristics of projection
pursuit indexes that are help to measure optimisaer performance.
Section~\ref{sec-simulation} describes a simulation study on performance
of the jellyfish for several types of data and index functions.
Section~\ref{sec-conclusion} summarises the work and provides
suggestions for future directions.

\section{Projection pursuit, index functions and optimisation {[}Di and
Sherry{]}}\label{sec-background}

A tour on high-dimensional data is constructed by geodesically
interpolating between pairs of planes. Any plane is described by an
orthonormal basis, \(A_t\), where \(t\) represents time in the sequence.
The term ``geodesic'' refers to maintaining the orthonormality
constraint so that each view shown is correctly a projection of the
data. The PP guided tour operates by geodesically interpolating to
target planes (projections) which have high PP index values, as provided
by the optimiser. The geodesic interpolation means that the viewer sees
a continuous sequence of projections of the data, so they can watch
patterns of interest forming as the function is optimised. There are
five optimisation methods implemented in the \texttt{tourr} package:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{search\_geodesic()}: provides a pseudo-derivative
  optimisation. It searches locally for the best direction, based on
  differencing the index values for very close projections. Then it
  follows the direction along the geodesic path between planes, stopping
  when the next index value fails to increase.
\item
  \texttt{search\_better()}: is a brute-force optimisation searching
  randomly for projections with higher index values.
\item
  \texttt{search\_better\_random()}: is essentially simulated annealing
  \citep{Bertsimas93} where the search space is reduced as the
  optimisation progresses.
\item
  \texttt{search\_posse()}: implements the algorithm described in
  \citet{posse95}.
\item
  \texttt{search\_polish()}: is a very localised search, to take tiny
  steps to get closer to the local maximum.
\end{itemize}

There are several PP index functions available: \texttt{holes()} and
\texttt{cmass()} \citep{cook1993projection}; \texttt{lda\_pp()}
\citep{lee2005projection}; \texttt{pda\_pp()} \citep{lee2010projection};
\texttt{dcor2d()} and \texttt{splines2d()} \citep{Grimm2016};
\texttt{norm\_bin()} and \texttt{norm\_kol()} \citep{huber85};
\texttt{slice\_index()} \citep{Laa:2020wkm}. Most are relatively simply
defined, for any projection dimension, and implemented because they are
relatively easy to optimise. A goal is to be able to incorporate more
complex PP indexes, for example based on scagnostics (\citet{scag},
\citet{WW08}).

An initial investigation of PP indexes, and the potential for
scagnostics is described in \citet{laa_using_2020}. To be useful here an
optimiser needs to be able to handle functions which are not very
smooth. In addition, because data structures might be relatively fine,
the optimiser needs to be able to find maxima that occur with a small
squint angle, that can only be seen from very close by. One last aspect
that is useful is for an optimiser to return local maxima in addition to
global because data can contain many different and interesting features.

\section{The jellyfish optimiser and properties of PP indexes {[}Nicolas
and Jessica{]}}\label{sec-theory}

The jellyfish optimiser (JSO) mimics the natural movements of jellyfish,
which include passive and active motions driven by ocean currents and
their swimming patterns, respectively. In the context of optimization,
these movements are abstracted to explore the search space in a way that
balances exploration (searching new areas) and exploitation (focusing on
promising areas). The algorithm aims to find the optimal solution by
adapting the jellyfish's behavior to navigate towards the best solution
over iterations \citep{chou_novel_2021}.

Below is the pseudo-code for this visualisation application.

{[}Put the pseudo-code in, add specifics to this visualisation
application{]}

The JSO implementation involves several key parameters that control its
search process in optimization problems. These parameters are designed
to guide the exploration and exploitation phases of the algorithm. While
the specific implementation details can vary depending on the version of
the algorithm or its application, we focus on two main parameters that
are most relevant to our application: the number of jellyfish and drift.

\citet{laa_using_2020} has proposed five criteria for assessing
projection pursuit indexes (smoothness, squintability, flexibility,
rotation invariance, and speed). Since not all the properties affects
the execution of the optimisation, here we consider the three relevant
properties (smoothness, squintability, and speed), and propose three
metrics to evaluate these three properties.

\subsection{Smoothness}\label{smoothness}

An intuitive way to measure smoothness of a function would be to count
how many continuous derivatives exist. To help define smoothness in our
context, we can make use of the Sobolev spaces: functions \(f\) in the
Sobolev space \(W^{p,\infty}\) have all derivatives of order less than
\(p\) continuous. Smoothness would then be the highest \(p\) such that
the index function belongs to \(W^{p,\infty}\). We can relax this and
consider \(W^{p,q}\) Sobolev spaces.

Consider the following definition of partial derivative. Let \(U\) be an
open subset of \(\mathbf{R}^n\) and \(f: U \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\). The
partial derivative of function \(f\) at the point
\(\mathbf{a} = (a_1, \ldots, a_n) \in U\) with respective to the
\(i\)-th variable \(x_i\) is defined as

\[
\frac{\delta}{\delta x_i} f(\mathbf{a}) =  \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a_1, \ldots, a_{i-1}, a_i +h, a_{i+1}, \ldots, a_n) - f(a_1 , \ldots, a_i, \ldots, a_n)}{h} = \lim_{h\rightarrow 0} \frac{f(\mathbf{a} + h\mathbf{e_i}) - f(\mathbf{a})}{h}.
\] where \(\mathbf{e_i}\) is the unit vector of the \(i\)-th variable
\(x_i\).

If the derivative is not well-defined, we propose to approximate the
derivative using the following expression:

\[\frac{1}{n_i}\sum_{i} \frac{\|f(\mathbf{a} + h_i\mathbf{e_i}) - f(\mathbf{a})\|^p}{h_i}\]

where \(p \in [0,1]\). The choice of \(p\) reflects the penalty
behaviour. For the application in this paper, we choose \(p = 1\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(h_i\) is an neighbourhood area around \(a\). We can insert different
  values of \(h\) to approximate the above quantity and observe how this
  quantity changes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Squintability}\label{squintability}

From the literature, it is commonly understood that a large squint angle
implies that the function is easy to optimize, because we do not need to
be very close to the perfect view to see the structure. A small squint
angle means that the derivative of the index function can still be very
large values near the optimal point and will rapidly change as we get
even closer to the optimum. As such we can observe the second order
gradient, which is the rate of change of gradient, over the space we are
searching. For some index functions, the second order gradient is not
well-defined, we can approximate the second order gradient vector in
similar fashion as the above section.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to measure the
notion of squintability.

\subsection{Speed}\label{speed}

The speed of optimizing an index function can be calculated/measured
using the computational complexity (in big O notation, with respect to
the sample size) of computing the index function.

\section{Application {[}Di and Sherry{]}}\label{sec-simulation}

The jellyfish optimiser has been implemented in the tourr package
\citep{wickham_tourr_2011} and we will use the diagnostic plots proposed
in the ferrn package \citep{RJ-2021-105} to visualise the optimisation
process.

\subsection{Going beyond 10D}\label{going-beyond-10d}

The pipe-finding problem is initially used to investigate indexes and
optimisers in \citet{laa_using_2020}, and we extend it from a 6D problem
to a 12D problem.

Jellyfish optimiser, as a multi-start algorithm, is efficient in
{[}\ldots{]} for high-dimensional problems
