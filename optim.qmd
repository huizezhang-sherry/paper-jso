# Introduction [Nicolas and Jessica]

The artificial jellyfish search (JS) algorithm [@chou_novel_2021] is a swarm-based metaheuristic optimisation algorithm inspired by the search behaviour of jellyfish in the ocean. It is one of the newest swarm intelligence algorithms [@rajwar_exhaustive_2023], which was shown to have stronger search ability and faster convergence with few algorithmic parameters compared to classic optimization methods [@chou_novel_2021]-[@chou_recent_2022].

The rest of the paper is organised as follows: @sec-background introduces the projection pursuit method, including the indexes function and optimisation. @sec-theory introduces the jellyfish optimiser and proposes mathematical expressions to measure the . @sec-simulation applies the jellyfish optimiser through different projection pursuit problems with varying dimensions and index functions. @sec-conclusion concludes the paper. 

# Projection pursuit, index functions and optimisation [Di and Sherry] {#sec-background} 

# The jellyfish optimiser and property for good optimisers [Nicolas and Jessica] {#sec-theory} 

The jellyfish optimiser [@chou_novel_2021] ...

@laa_using_2020 has proposed five criteria for assessing projection pursuit indexes (smoothness, squintability, flexibility, rotation invariance, and speed). Since not all the properties affects the optimisation, here we define the three relevant properties (smoothness, squintability, and speed) mathematically and show that the jellyfish optimiser ...

# Application [Di and Sherry] {#sec-simulation}

The jellyfish optimiser has been implemented in the tourr package [@wickham_tourr_2011] and we will use the diagnostic plots proposed in the ferrn package [@RJ-2021-105] to visualise the optimisation process.

## Going beyond 10D 

The pipe-finding problem is initially used to investigate indexes and optimisers in @laa_using_2020, and we extend it from a 6D problem to a 12D problem.

Jellyfish optimiser, as a multi-start algorithm, is efficient in [...] for high-dimensional problems

<!-- # Bibliography styles -->

<!-- Here are two sample references:  @Feynman1963118 @Dirac1953888. -->

<!-- By default, natbib will be used with the `authoryear` style, set in `classoption` variable in YAML.  -->

<!-- You can sets extra options with `natbiboptions` variable in YAML header. Example  -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- natbiboptions: longnamesfirst,angle,semicolon -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- There are various more specific bibliography styles available at -->

<!-- <https://support.stmdocs.in/wiki/index.php?title=Model-wise_bibliographic_style_files>.  -->

<!-- To use one of these, add it in the header using, for example, `biblio-style: model1-num-names`. -->

<!-- ## Using CSL  -->

<!-- If `cite-method` is set to `citeproc` in `elsevier_article()`, then pandoc is used for citations instead of `natbib`. In this case, the `csl` option is used to format the references. By default, this template will provide an appropriate style, but alternative `csl` files are available from <https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=elsevier>. These can be downloaded -->

<!-- and stored locally, or the url can be used as in the example header. -->

<!-- # Equations -->

<!-- Here is an equation: -->

<!-- $$  -->

<!--   f_{X}(x) = \left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right) -->

<!--   \left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)^{\alpha-1} -->

<!--   e^{-\left(\frac{x}{\beta}\right)^{\alpha}};  -->

<!--   \alpha,\beta,x > 0 . -->

<!-- $$ -->

<!-- Inline equations work as well: $\sum_{i = 2}^\infty\{\alpha_i^\beta\}$ -->

<!-- # Figures and tables -->

<!-- @fig-meaningless is generated using an R chunk. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- #| label: fig-meaningless -->

<!-- #| fig-cap: A meaningless scatterplot -->

<!-- #| fig-width: 5 -->

<!-- #| fig-height: 5 -->

<!-- #| fig-align: center -->

<!-- #| out-width: 50% -->

<!-- #| echo: false -->

<!-- plot(runif(25), runif(25)) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- # Tables coming from R -->

<!-- Tables can also be generated using R chunks, as shown in @tbl-simple example. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- #| label: tbl-simple -->

<!-- #| tbl-cap: Caption centered above table -->

<!-- #| echo: true -->

<!-- knitr::kable(head(mtcars)[,1:4]) -->

<!-- ``` -->
